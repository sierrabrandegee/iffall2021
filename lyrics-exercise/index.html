            <p2>I synthesize my legs and eyes, my better side</p>
            <p2>I made you just me, dignified</p>
            <p2>Now I get to see you voguin' like I don't know how</p>
            <p2>Could you side with me, confide in me and reside in me?</p>
            <p2>Make it big and sign for me</p>
            <p2>Get me into trouble, check me as I mumble</p>

            <p2>You're fillin' me with jealousy, it's killin' me</p>
            <p2>I give myself up willingly</p>
            <p2>Just so you can take me back to where you hang around</p>
            <p2>If I harden up, if I sharpen up, if I'm smart enough</p>
            <p2>Then I'll know it in my heart enough</p>
            <p2>To catch up with my double, check me as I mumble</p>
            <p2>Catch me as I stumble down</p>
