    </div>

        <h2>Materials</h2>

        <div class="box">
        <p>Mixer (can use whisk, but it will take much longer)</p>
        <p>Double boiler (can use bowl and pot of same size to create your own double boiler)</p>
        <p>2 mixing bowls, one for heavy whipping cream, one for eggs</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <div class="box">
        <p>1. Whip the heavy whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Chill in refrigerator.</p>
        <p>2. Melt the chocolate, cubed butter, and espresso in the top of a double boiler over hot, steamy water. Stir continuously until smooth. Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat and let cool until it is warm to the touch. Do not let the mixture get too cool.</p>
        <p>3. Whip the egg whites until they are foamy and hold shape. Sprinkle in the sugar and whip until it forms stiff peaks.</p>
        <p>4. While the chocolate is still warm, stir in the egg yolks.</p>
        <p>5. Gently stir in one third of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Then fold in half the egg whites. Fold in the remaining egg whites. Fold in the remaining whipped cream.</p>
        <p>6. Chill in refrigerator for 8-24 hours. You can use a piping bag to create a fancy texture or just scoop directly into serving dishes. Top with whipped cream, raspberries, or another fruit of your choice and serve!</p>

        <p>I think that <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">All Recipes</a> is a good website for recipes because it allows people to submit recipes. I think that the format in which it
            presents the ingredients/instructions is very user friendly, including a checklist of ingredients that you can use while you are cooking and an overview 
            which lays out prep time, cook time, servings, etc.</p>
        
        <p>I think that <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com">Simply Recipes</a> is an aesthetically successful recipe website in the way in which it uses images and typefaces. However, I think that
            it has too much 'introductory' text that gets in the way of the recipe itself.</p>
        
        <p>I think that <a href="https://tasty.co/">Tasty</a> is a good recipe website becuase it focuses solely on the recipe itself, which a lot of other websites tend to bury with extra text.
            The page does not adjust well to different browser sizes, but other than that I think it is a successful recipe page.</p>

        <p>I think that <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/?from_belo_click">Airbnb</a> has elements that could be applicable to a recipe page such as a photo gallery and places for reviews. I also believe
            it is a good example because of how it works with everyday people to upload and organize the information that they give to market their living space.</p>

        <p>I think that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords">NY Times</a> is a good website to look at for inspiration when it comes to visual design and how simplicity can help the viewer consume
            the page. I think that the way that they encourage you to click on related items is successful as well.</p>

        <p>I think that <a href="https://quizlet.com">Quizlet</a> is another website that shows how to effectively take information from users and help distribute, share, and display it in an effective manner.
            Their search methods are also very effective through the use of filters of different subjects, detecting languages, and connecting to specific classes at specific schools.</p>
